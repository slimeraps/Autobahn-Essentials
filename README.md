## Changelog

### May 25th

#### Release 6.3.0 Racing UI pass — smart header, GPU glow, sharpened type, rounded CTAs

- Added a smart sticky header that hides on scroll-down and reappears on scroll-up, driven by a `requestAnimationFrame`-throttled scroll listener in `assets/theme.js` with a 6px intent threshold and a `transform: translate3d(0, -112%, 0)` hide state on `.site-header--sticky.is-hidden`.
- Sharpened the homepage hero typography in `.hero h1`: explicit Montserrat 900, `letter-spacing: -0.018em`, `line-height: 0.84`, `font-feature-settings: "ss01","kern"`, and `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` for a tighter, more geometric headline.
- Tightened the hero typewriter rhythm in `assets/theme.js` — `typeDelay 105→72ms`, `eraseDelay 55→36ms`, `phraseHoldDuration 4000→3400ms`.
- Added an orange-to-transparent radial glow hover on `.product-card`, `.collection-card`, `.article-card`, `.ae-build-card`, and `.promo-tile` via a `::before` pseudo-element keyed off `#e8432a`. Glow uses `opacity` + `transform: translate3d(0,0,0) scale()` only, with `will-change` scoped to `:hover` and a reduced-motion fallback.
- Converted card, button, and header transitions from `ease` to `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` for a snappier responsive feel. Hover lifts moved from `translateY` to `translate3d` so they composite on the GPU.
- De-templatized the chrome — buttons now use `font-weight: 900` + `letter-spacing: 0.04em` + `padding: 13px 22px`, with sharp racing edges on smaller chrome (selects, fields, fitment badges, spec items) at `border-radius: 3px`.
- Rounded off the primary CTAs and feature cards per request: `.button` / `.shopify-payment-button__button` to `999px` pills (covers Shop Now and View Builds); `.collection-card`, `.collection-grid--featured .collection-card`, `.promo-tile`, and `.spec-item` (Performance Tested / Enthusiast Owned / Euro Focused / Fast Shipping strip) to `border-radius: 16px`.
- Hid the visible "Skip to content" link without breaking accessibility — it is now visually clipped (`clip-path: inset(50%)`) and only appears at top-left on `:focus` / `:focus-visible`. The DOM element and link target are unchanged.

### May 22nd

#### Release 6.2.0 Homepage hero artwork and orange divider

- Replaced the homepage hero fallback image with `AE-hero-new.png` — a wide-landscape orange Lamborghini Urus and BMW M4 photo (6000x3376) that fills the hero crop edge-to-edge instead of leaning on the previous parking-garage M4 shot.
- Updated the hero image's `width`/`height` attributes and alt text in `sections/hero-autobahn.liquid` so the browser can reserve the right aspect ratio and screen readers describe the new scene.
- Added an 18px solid `var(--color-accent)` border below the hero so the section ends with a clean orange band before transitioning into the spec strip, replacing the previous borderless cut.
- Heads-up: the new hero image is a ~15MB PNG. The Shopify CDN compresses it for the merchant-uploaded path, but the fallback ships at full size. Consider re-exporting as an optimized JPG before launch.

### May 21st

#### Release 6.1.4 Homepage hero shortened and Builds schema fix

- Shrunk the homepage hero so its total visual height matches the Autobahn Blog page hero: lowered `.hero` min-height to `clamp(380px, 44vw, 520px)` desktop / `440px` mobile, trimmed `.hero__content` padding, and removed the 110-210px image bleed-down that pushed the orange BMW behind the spec strip and inflated the perceived hero size.
- Switched the homepage hero image crop to `object-position: center center` so the focal point is the geometric center of the image regardless of which artwork is assigned.
- Fixed an upload-blocking schema error on `sections/page-builds-autobahn.liquid`: changed the Instagram URL setting from `type: url` to `type: text` because Shopify's `url` setting type rejects external URLs as defaults, which was also preventing `templates/page.builds.json` from resolving its section.

#### Release 6.1.3 Autobahn Blog hero text removed and overlay disabled

- Removed the eyebrow, heading, and hero text from the Autobahn Blog hero so a custom hero artwork can carry the page header on its own. Removed the now-unused eyebrow/heading/text settings from the section schema.
- Added an `ae-page-hero--no-overlay` modifier and applied it to the Autobahn Blog hero so the dark left-to-right gradient overlay no longer fights with the uploaded artwork. The Builds hero keeps the original overlay.

#### Release 6.1.2 Autobahn Blog hero image fix

- Swapped the default Autobahn Blog hero from the night BMW photo (almost entirely black and portrait-cropped, leaving the page hero rendering as solid black behind the dark page overlay) to the G82 BMW M4 sunset shot, which the existing dark hero overlay turns into a moody editorial frame.
- Added a Hero image picker to the Autobahn Blog section so a custom photo can be uploaded from the theme editor without code changes.

#### Release 6.1.1 Autobahn Blog hero polish

- Swapped the AE.Blog page hero image from the generic Autobahn SVG silhouette to the night BMW photo (`fallback-hero-night-bmw.jpg`) so the page leads with the darker editorial tone used elsewhere on the site.
- Renamed the AE.Blog page hero heading default from "AE.Blog" to "Autobahn Blog".
- Removed the "Grid text" support copy on the right side of the Recent Stories heading on the AE.Blog page.

#### Release 6.1.0 AE.Blog vertical redesign and persistent post history button

- Replaced the 3-column AE.Blog grid with a full-width vertical list where each post renders as a horizontal row: image on the left, eyebrow date, title, excerpt, tags, and a Read post link stacked on the right.
- Made the post images bigger (4:3 on desktop, 16:9 on mobile) and applied a small vertical translate so the image sits offset from the body for a more editorial layout.
- Added a subtle hover lift on each post image and a top divider between consecutive posts.
- Made the Post history button at the bottom of the AE.Blog page render unconditionally so it is visible before the source blog reaches eleven posts, and renamed it from "View blog history" to "Post history".

#### Release 6.0.1 align AE. Blog nav with other items

- Added an explicit AE. Blog branch to the header so it renders between Builds and Contacts in the same code path as the other top-level nav links, eliminating a font/style mismatch from the previous catch-all render.
- Hardcoded the AE. Blog display text and excluded "blog" titles from the header catch-all so the link cannot render twice if the merchant menu also contains an AE. Blog item.
- Default AE. Blog destination is `/pages/ae-blog`; a menu item whose title contains "blog" overrides the destination.

#### Release 6.0.0 AE.Blog page and Builds reset

- Added a new AE.Blog page template (`templates/page.ae-blog.json`) and section (`sections/page-ae-blog-autobahn.liquid`) that auto-feeds the latest 10 posts from the `autobahn-blog` Shopify blog, newest first.
- Added a "View blog history" button on the AE.Blog page that appears once the source blog has more than 10 posts, linking to Shopify's built-in archive at `/blogs/autobahn-blog`.
- Added a theme-editor Blog source picker on AE.Blog so the source blog can be changed without code edits.
- Stripped the Builds page (`sections/page-builds-autobahn.liquid`) to hero-only ahead of a future gallery redesign.
- Removed the manual "Build card" theme-editor blocks, the grid, and the "Submit a build" CTA from the Builds page schema. Cards are now driven by published blog posts on the AE.Blog page instead of hand-maintained blocks.

### May 14th

#### 11:48PM PST - Release 5.5 restore 5.1 hero treatment with new image

- Reverted the homepage hero CSS to the 5.1 treatment: restored the `autobahn-hero.svg` underlay, the dark left-to-right and bottom gradient overlays, and `object-fit: cover` at `center 58%` desktop / `62% center` mobile.
- Kept the new `AE-hero4.png` artwork wired up as the hero fallback so the polished 5.1 fitment now frames the new orange BMW M4 image.

#### 11:32PM PST - Release 5.4 restore 5.1 hero crop

#### 11:10PM PST - Release 5.2 transparent hero over site background
